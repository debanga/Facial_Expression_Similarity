## Note!
We find that densenet block is not import for Model. you can easily replace it with Conv3*3  
Our model structure is the same as [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark)  
## Prerequisites
- PyTorch 1.0
  - `pip3 install torch torchvision`
- Easydict
  - `pip3 install easydict`
- [Apex](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/index.html)
- Ninja
  - `sudo apt-get install ninja-build`
- tqdm
  - `pip3 install tqdm`  


## Model Zoo
### Supported Model
- ResNet18
- Inception N22
- Inception Resnet
- ResNet50
## Datasets
Be Careful! Our model does not use all the triple pairs because of the loss of crawler data. In addition, we use our own align model. If you need our processed data, please email me qiulingteng@stu.hit.edu.cn. google original dataset is in here(https://ai.google/tools/datasets/google-facial-expression/).

For the benefit of everyone, hence I upload my processed data to Baidu WebDisk so that everyone can download and research.  
Note that our collected have a lit bit loss due to orignial datasets website link error. link address is given byï¼š

The format of annotations you can refer to  train_list and test_list. 
Key: ndcm
## File Structure
```
  -- PROJECT_ROOT
  -- Triple Dataset
     |-- train_align
     |-- annotations
```
In annotations, your training triple data name save into \*.txt  
All of it, you can change in [paths_catalog.py](./configs/paths_catalog.py)
## Link
we must build the env for training 
```bash
make link
```
soft link to result

## Experiment Results
Backbone | ONE_CLASS ACC | TWO_CLASS ACC | THREE_CLASS ACC| ACC
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
 InceptionNN2+denseblock  | 76.4 | 78.8 | 77.8 | 77.3
 InceptionResnet+denseblock   | 64.1 | 70.0 | 65.2  | 66.9 
 Resnet18+Conv3*3   | 78.2 | 80.5 | 80.2 | 79.7
 Resnet50+Conv3*3   | 78.5 | 81.3 | 80.9 | 80.3

## Training
1. create the config file of dataset:`train_list.txt`   
2. modify the `config/*.yaml` according to your requirements

### Distributed Training
We use the official `torch.distributed.launch` in order to launch multi-gpu training. This utility function from PyTorch spawns as many Python processes as the number of GPUs we want to use, and each Python process will only use a single GPU.

For each experiment, you can just run this script:
```bash
export NGPUS=8
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=$NGPUS train.py
```

### Non-distributed Training
The above performance are all conducted based on the non-distributed training.
For each experiment, you can just run this script:
```bash
bash train.sh
```
## Inference
In the evaluator, we have implemented the multi-gpu inference base on the multi-process. In the inference phase, the function will spawns as many Python processes as the number of GPUs we want to use, and each Python process will handle a subset of the whole evaluation dataset on a single GPU.
1. input arguments in shell:
    ```bash
    bash inference.sh
    ```
